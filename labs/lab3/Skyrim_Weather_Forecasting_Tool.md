# Skyrim Weather Forecasting Tool

Skyrim is a project that lets you run advanced weather models. Itâ€™s awesome because you can generate detailed weather forecasts on your regular computer without needing a supercomputer. I think this tool could be super helpful in civil and environmental engineering projects since having accurate weather data is important for designing buildings and roads that can handle extreme weather, planning construction projects to avoid bad weather delays, and even setting up better flood defenses. We can import monthly, or even longer periods of time's weather averages. Overall, Skyrim makes it easier for students and engineers to use weather models in their projects.
